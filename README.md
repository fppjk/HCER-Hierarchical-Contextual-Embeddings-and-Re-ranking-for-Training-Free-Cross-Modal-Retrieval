# HCER: Hierarchical Contextual Embeddings and Re-ranking for Training Free Cross-Modal Retrieval
HCER: Hierarchical Contextual Embeddings and Re-ranking for Training-Free Cross-Modal Retrieval

## Abstract

Generation-based training-free cross-modal retrieval leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to map images into textual descriptions for unified matching. However, holistic embeddings often dilute fine-grained visual features due to semantic redundancy, the sparse distribution of atomic-level semantics within long sequences, and the inability of cosine similarity to verify complex cross-modal consistency. 

To overcome these limitations, we propose **HCER (Hierarchical Contextual Embeddings and Re-ranking)**, a fully training-free framework following a **"Decomposition-Hierarchy-Verification"** paradigm. 
1. **Decomposition**: Utilizes frozen MLLMs with structured prompts to transform visual inputs into multi-perspective textual descriptions, extracting explicit atomic-level semantic units. 
2. **Hierarchy**: Introduces Hierarchical Contextual Embeddings (HCE), which decouples these descriptions into an independent stream for local discriminative power and a joint stream for global contextual coherence, fusing them to prevent detail dilution. 
3. **Verification**: Employs an MLLM-based Semantic Consistency Reasoning Re-ranking module to perform explicit logical validation on Top-K candidates, moving beyond surface-level statistical similarity. 

Extensive experiments on **Flickr30K** and **MSCOCO** demonstrate that HCER significantly improves zero-shot retrieval performance, particularly in Recall@1, proving the efficacy of integrating atomic-level semantics with explicit reasoning without task-specific optimization.

## Framework

The project follows a **"Decomposition-Hierarchy-Verification"** paradigm, which consists of the following core steps:

- **Semantic Decomposition**: Utilizes structured prompts to transform images into multi-view, atomic-level semantic descriptions.
- **Hierarchical Contextual Embeddings (HCE)**: Mitigates semantic dilution in long descriptive sequences by effectively fusing local discriminative power with global contextual coherence.
- **Reasoning-based Re-ranking**: Leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform explicit logical consistency verification on Top-K candidates.
